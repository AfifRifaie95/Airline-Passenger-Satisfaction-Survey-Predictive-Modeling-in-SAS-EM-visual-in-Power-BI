## Project Overview

This study aims to establish predictive algorithms using SAS Enterprise Miner. The dataset used in this report is an Airline Passenger Satisfaction Survey, which is available on Kaggle. It contains the survey parameter with a target variable of satisfaction (Satisfied / Neutral or Dissatisfied) with passenger demographic information and airline service dimensions, such as delay times. 

The outcome of this study provides data-driven guidelines for the airline company to identify which service dimensions contribute to the dissatisfaction, hence, to improve their service quality.

## Objectives 
1. to gain insights into airline service dimensions and consumer demographics that influence customer satisfaction through conducting exploratory data analysis.
   
2. to establish a machine learning model using SAS Enterprise Miner that able to:
- Categorize satisfaction of airline service dimension ratings and client demographics.
- Deploy, apply, and compare predictive modeling strategies to determine the optimal performance model.
- Critically interpret the data.
3. to make strategic recommendations to boost customer satisfaction and improve business growth.
